## Pokémon PythonRed

### Important Notes:

* This is _not_ a perfect recreation of Pokémon Red; it's a custom story that takes place in the Kanto region, a test of my own coding skills and creativity.
* This is my first GitHub project, and I’m not very acquainted to its features and capabilities.
* I've only recently learnt Markdown, specifically for this project.

Summary: **_Don’t Judge_!**

### To Play:

First, ensure you have `Python` installed. If not, you can find the installer [here](https://sdassq-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ba004629_bac_qld_edu_au/ESCL5J4RZcFLrzRbpcnyy6EBjn22m7ZuFJQMH7HiIW0XFw?e=cFyr1g) (v3.6.8). Tick the box that says `Add Python to PATH` during installation.

This also installs `pip` which is required in the next step.

Open Command Prompt and _individually_ run any any below commands to install dependencies:

`pip install playsound`

When that's all done, to download the game, please see [Releases](https://github.com/TurnipGuy30/Pokemon-PythonRed/releases)!

### Pokémon Data
The entire Kanto Pokédex will be stored as a variable, with a list item for each species:

```
Pokemon = [[],[],[]...]
```

Each `[]` includes this:

```
[Pokédex #, Name, Type 1, Type 2, Base HP, Base ATK, Base DEF, Base SP. ATK, Base SP. DEF, Base SPD, Catch Rate]
```

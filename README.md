[Discussions](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/discussions "Pokémon PythonRed Discussions") is a great place to ask questions or give feedback!

<details><summary>Important Notes</summary>

---
- This is not a perfect recreation of `Pokémon Red`; it's a fan-made game that, like `Pokémon Red`, takes place in the fictional Kanto region.
- Prior in-depth knowledge of the `Pokémon` franchise, especially the video game series, is recommended and may be required to fully enjoy this game.
- This project (this GitHub Repository and anything found within) is not endorsed by _Nintendo_, _GAME FREAK_, _Creatures Inc._, _The Pokémon Company_, or whoever owns the franchise these days. This is an independent, fan-made game.
- This game's plot is a work of fiction! Any references to real people or events are completely coincidental.
- The developers use Windows 10 OS, but some effort will be made to make this game cross-platform. However, if we cannot find a way to implement an element in this way, then this game will become Windows 10-only.

**These credits will be in-game!** If you want your name included, head to [Discussions](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/discussions "Pokémon PythonRed Discussions") and ask what you can help with!

### Installation
- Obviously, Python 3 is required to run the game, at least for now. The latest installer can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Latest"). Tick the box that says `Add Python to PATH` during installation.
- To download the game, please run `Pokémon PythonRed.py`. Keep in mind that next-to-nothing has been done so far; this is a *huge* project for someone like myself.
- Currently, there is no music in the game. **I do have plans to add music**, but probably not until the main game is completed. If you find text in the game that automatically proceeds after a set amount of time, it's probably timed to currently-inexistent music.
- If you encounter any problems when opening the game please check the FAQs section below. If problems persist, feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/issues "Pokémon PythonRed Issues").

### FAQs

- When opening the game, I get a message that says `Please install the required dependencies before playing.`

This means you don't have one or more modules the game needs to run. Open your favourite Shell Terminal and run this command:
```
[coming soon]
```
  - More commands will be added above as they are needed
  - Common Shell Terminals include `Command Prompt`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Git CMD`, etc.

- I have a bug report or feature request! Where do I submit it?

For bugs, contribution specifications, or feature requests, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/issues "Pokémon PythonRed Issues")! Your comment will be kept in mind.

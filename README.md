<details><summary>Important Notes</summary>

---
- This is not a perfect recreation of `Pokémon Red`; it's a fan-made game that, like `Pokémon Red`, takes place in the fictional Kanto region.
- Prior in-depth knowledge of the `Pokémon` franchise, especially the video game series, is recommended and may be required to fully enjoy this game.
- This project (this GitHub Repository and anything found within) is not endorsed by _Nintendo_, _GAME FREAK_, _Creatures Inc._, _The Pokémon Company_, or whoever owns the franchise these days. This is an independent, fan-made game.
- This game's plot is a work of fiction! Any references to real people or events are completely coincidental.
- The developers use Windows 10 OS, but some effort will be made to make this game cross-platform. However, if we cannot find a way to implement an element in this way, then this game will become Windows 10-only.

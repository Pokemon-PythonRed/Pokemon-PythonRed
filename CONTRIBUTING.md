# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking an interest! Pokémon PythonRed started as a small personal project, but has quickly grown into a helpful and interested community.

If you'd like to contribute, here are some things you could do:

- Test the game with [the Installation guide](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed#installation) and [leave some feedback](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/discussions)
- Make a [feature request](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/issues/new/choose)
- Help with [programming](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/tree/master/app) (please see [our conventions page](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md))
- Create some art (ASCII text)
- Check for incorrect data in the [JSON databases](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed/tree/master/app)

All contributors will be added to [the Contributors list](https://github.com/Pokemon-PythonRed/Pokemon-PythonRed#contributors), which will later be incorporated into in-game credits! If you would like us to omit your contribution from the list, just let us know.

When contributing, keep the following in mind:

- Owners and managers can change any contributed material as they see fit.
